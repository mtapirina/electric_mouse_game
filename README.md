# Electric Mouse - Codecademy - Phaser.JS Game Dev Project

Let’s combine our knowledge of objects to finish building a game that pits our Electric Mouse against the Psychic Hairless Cat and its Owl minions!

The premise of the game is that there are two characters battling each other. 
The player is an Electric Mouse, and the computer is the Psychic Hairless Cat and its Owl Minions. 
Before the player can fight the Psychic Hairless Cat, the player must beat three Owl minions. 
The player and computer will simultaneously choose one of three moves, Attack, Defend, and Special Attack, 
the result of the selections are then displayed on the screen.

_We will be working in one file called GameScene.js. 
In GameScene.js you will be using a gameState object to store the state of the game. gameState will keep track of all states of our characters, buttons, 
and text information will be held. We’ll get a sneak peek at sprite and animation creation using some Phaser syntax. 
We also have to build out the logic for our Attack and Defend buttons._

For an extra challenge try to:
* Tweak the difficulty of the game by deciding your own HP values for Electric mouse and/or enemies. +
* Change the logic for defend to heal both characters if they both choose to defend. +
* Give the Electric mouse additional lives at the beginning. +
* Edit the styling of the informational text.
* Creating another move that the player and computer can do (Special Defense?).
* Create logic that determines move accuracy so that the player or computer can miss.
